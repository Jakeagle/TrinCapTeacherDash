# Unit Assignment Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing APIs**: Added `allStudents`, `studentsInPeriod`, and `assignUnitToStudent` endpoints to the main server
2. **Student Notification**: Added socket listener in student app to handle new unit assignments
3. **Admin Assignment**: Fixed admin@trinity-capital.net logic to assign units to ALL students with proper error handling
4. **Lesson Content**: Modified unit assignment to fetch actual lesson content from lesson server

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Admin Assignment (admin@trinity-capital.net)

1. Login to teacher dashboard as `admin@trinity-capital.net`
2. Go to Lesson Management and create or select a unit
3. Click "Assign to Class" button - should show "Assign Unit to All Students" dialog
4. Confirm assignment - should assign to ALL students in the system
5. Check student apps - they should receive unit assignment notification and lessons should appear

### 2. Test Regular Teacher Assignment

1. Login to teacher dashboard as any teacher (not admin)
2. Go to Lesson Management and select a unit
3. Click "Assign to Class" button - should show period selector
4. Select a period and confirm - should assign to only students in that period
5. Check student apps for students in that period - they should receive notifications

### 3. Test Student App Reception

1. Open student app
2. When a unit is assigned, student should see:
   - Socket notification in console: "Unit assignment received"
   - Visual notification: "New lesson unit assigned: [Unit Name] by [Teacher]"
   - Lessons panel should update with new unit content
   - Unit should appear in student's lesson interface

## API Endpoints Added

- `GET /allStudents` - Returns all student IDs for admin assignment
- `GET /studentsInPeriod/:period` - Returns student IDs for specific period
- `POST /assignUnitToStudent` - Assigns unit to individual student with lesson content

## Socket Events Added

- `unitAssignedToStudent` - Emitted when unit is assigned to student
  - Contains: studentId, unitId, unitName, assignedBy, unitAssignment

## Error Handling Improvements

- Better error messages for failed API calls
- Progress indicators during assignment process
- Counts of successful vs failed assignments
- Fallback lesson content handling

## Console Debugging

Check these console logs to verify functionality:

### Teacher Dashboard Console:

- "Found X students for admin assignment" (admin mode)
- "Found X students in period Y" (teacher mode)
- "Successfully assigned unit to student [ID]" (per student)

### Student App Console:

- "Unit assignment received: [data]"
- "New unit '[name]' assigned by [teacher]"
- "Added new unit to student profile: [unit]"

### Main Server Console:

- "Assigning unit '[name]' to student [ID] by [teacher]"
- "Found X lessons for unit [name]"
- "Successfully assigned unit with X lessons to student [ID]"

## Notes

- Admin assignments affect ALL students regardless of teacher/period
- Regular teacher assignments only affect students in selected period
- Units are assigned with full lesson content populated
- Duplicate assignments are prevented
- Student apps update in real-time via socket connections
